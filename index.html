                <h3>Visit Pygmies encampment</h3>
                <p>You will have the opportunity to visit the fascinating population of Pygmies who live few kilometers from the fall of the Lobe and Kribi. these are forest dwellers who are generally small, about 1.5m and feed mainly on hunting and fishing. Pygmies are characterised by their ancient rites, traditions, mesmerising songs, their magic dances, traditional medicine, and their uncommon hunting methods.</p>

                <h3>Lobe waterfalls</h3>
                <p>The Lobe Waterfalls are unique in Africa since it’s a waterfall that empties straight into the Atlantic Ocean! You go to visit it by a boat from a nearby beach, and after a short ride, you get right into the waterfall’s spray hitting the waves of the ocean. The waterfall is only about 20 meters / 65 feet high as the water pours over a ledge, but it’s quite wide and you can sail in a boat its entire length while being the mist. It’s one of the main attractions in Kribi and is worth every minute and every CFA franc you spend on it.</p>
