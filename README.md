# Getting Started

My first solo project is a homepage for my Hometown Kribi. 
Kribi is a lovely resort town in the southern part of Cameroon where i was born and raised.
Using HTML and CSS skills i learned from scrimba i will build and deploy a homepage highlighting popular attractions and places to visit.

Thanks
